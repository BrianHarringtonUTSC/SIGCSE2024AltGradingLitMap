,,,"Binary Grading is any paper where major components are graded as pass/fail or adequate/inadequate, whether they have one attempt or many","Bucketed Grading is any paper where major components are evalated into several buckets ""excellent, good, adequate, poor"" or ""mastery, competency, not yet"". So more than binary, but not on a grade scale",Mastery Learning is any paper where the final grade is calcualted based on the set of components the student has mastered or shown competency in (this is often called specifications grading or contract grading),"Any paper that involves multiple attempts at work, resubmissions, or flexible/no deadlines","Any paper that uses minimum grading (usually done as 50% but could be otherwise), where students get a non zero grade regardless of outcome","Any paper where students get significant input on their final grade calculation, this could come in the form of students actually suggesting a final grade, or arguing for particular grades, or setting weightings, etc",Anything where we evalute whether this worked by looking at the grades (in the course in question or in follow-on courses),"Anything looking at the impact of the actual class population (who shows up, how many stay, how many times they watch a video, etc) or how engaged they are in the course (do they do the readings, do sample questions etc)",Anything where they ask students how they felt/what they thought/whehther they prefer/did they enjoy/which version they would choose/etc),"Any non-affective (see previous column) evaluation of psychological factors: stress, sense of belonging, mindset, perceptions of computing in general, etc)",anything where they evaluated the amount of work it took on the part of the instructors/teaching team,anything where it evaluted the amount of work put in by students,,,,,,,
